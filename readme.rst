-------------------

Leon is an application framework for building smart web applications. We believe that in modern web applications the UI should be completely based on HTML(5), CSS and JavaScript, and be rendered in the browser while the server should provide strong AJAX / Comet communication mechanisms, database access, security management, etc.

Leon combines and integrates best-of-breed client frameworks like jQuery and AngularJS with it's strong server runtime. Even though Leon is JVM-based (implemented in Scala & Java), server-side code can be written in JavaScript as well. Leon's Java/JavaScript integration goes beyond simple method calls by providing automatic conversions of JavaScript objects and Java POJOs, for example.

For those who like it (we certainly do!), we provide automatic CoffeeScript and Less CSS generation. For example, CoffeeScript files can be used as a drop-in replacement and be used on the server- as well as client-side.
